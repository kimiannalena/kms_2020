#  Watch mode (--watch true) will wait and check for any file changes
#  and once it detects change it will rerun all the tests and again will wait for the next change.
#  It works extremely well in development but if it happens in CI, then it will think that the tests are still
#  running and will wait eternally. So it should be turned off there.
